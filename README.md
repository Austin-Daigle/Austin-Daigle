## Welcome to Austin Daigle's Repository:
I'm a Computer Science student interested and passionate about algorithm research and development, embedded hardware programming, Robotics, 3D printing, and machine learning models. This repo contains a variety of projects that I have developed over the years ranging from embedded system design to standalone application development.

Below is a curation of the significant projects, programs, collaborations, and developments that I have worked on dating back to 2014.
