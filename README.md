## Welcome to Austin Daigle's Repository:

I'm a Computer Science student with an interest and passion for algorithm research and development, embedded hardware programming, Robotics, 3D printing, and machine learning models. This repo contains a variety of projects that I have developed over the years ranging from embedded system design to standalone application development.

  

Below is a curation of all of the major projects, programs, collaborations, and developments going dating back to 2014.
